            <p class="cs1"> We are at our Happiest when running events. </p>
            <p class="cs2"> We love seeing the ideas that we have worked on with our clients come to life and happen before our very eyes. One of the many things that we love about the events industry is that no day is the same, every event is different and no client is the same. Here we showcase our proudest moments and the type of events that we run every day…</p>
            <p class="cs3">
                    We worked alongside London Business School for the fourth year to help produce and deliver their graduation ball, changing from a seated meal to a standing reception.
                    This year we took our client to the stunning Guildhall for a medieval madness theme with some Harry Potter references in there. Helping guests arrive for their drinks reception in The Library, were the living statues who would come alive as guests walked past. Keeping guests entertained was Judge the poet and silhouette artist before trumpeters appeared to announce the opening of the Great Hall. The moving picture wall, which consisted of video recordings of the students was an interesting talking point before reaching the main space. Here, guests were treated to an array of food and drinks by The Recipe, as well as entertainment in the form of fighting knights and an orchestra. Finally, The Crypts were opened later in the night, where the DJ and dancing took place.
                    Both of our clients were extremely happy with the new format – “It was an absolutely amazing night – everything looked even better than I hoped!”

                    A longstanding client of ours wanted a fun and relaxed Summer party at a venue with outside space including a wet weather option.
                    The beautiful Dartmouth House was the best option with it’s beautiful outside space which could accommodate 120 guests. There was an array of entertainment including The Wandering Hands, Florence make up artist, a magician and Keith the thief, to keep guests entertained throughout the evening. Alongside the delicious food and drinks that Dartmouth House served, there was a sweet stall and alcoholic ice lollies by Popscycle to keep guests refreshed all night.
                    RESULTS
                    “We just wanted to say a MASSIVE thank you for all of your hard work in making yesterday such a huge success. I am sure you could tell by all the happy murmurs that everyone was having a great time! We think this was the best summer party to date. Thank you so much for making everything perfect – as ALWAYS you are such a pleasure to work with! Every detail was carefully considered and it really showed in the extremely high quality of the event. We are so, so happy with how it went – you are amazing!!!”

                    We were tasked with finding our client an informal and relaxed venue to host their conference and dinner for 27 delegates. With an office based in Hemel Hempstead, they wanted a venue within Hertfordshire and near to their offices.                                    
                    The small conference was held at The Grove Hotel, located 20-minute drive from Hemel Hempstead, within easy reach for the delegates. The Grove was the perfect setting for this event, with several conference spaces with natural daylight and a trendy breakout space for catering. There was a great selection of cookies and smoothies during the breaks and a delicious buffet served for lunch, leaving guests ready for their afternoon of presentations. Following the meeting, guests were taken to the walled garden for drinks and a BBQ, including its own private beach! Guests enjoyed a magnificent spread and refreshing drinks throughout the evening finishing off with a good night’s sleep in the beautiful bedrooms.                          
                    Our client was exceptionally happy with the venue, having never heard of it before, they found it the right balance of relaxed and formal.
                    “Thank you for your professionalism, attention to detail and positive attitude. It was an absolute pleasure to work with you both and hopefully we will do so again in the future.”
